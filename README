This repository contains tools used and developed during the "Graphen und biologische Netze" Praktikum
at Leipzig University in the Winter Semester of 2019/2020.


The json2graph tool is used to convert biological molecules from PubChem JSON format to a custom .graph
format used by alignment tools used during the Praktikum:
 - https://github.com/Tschichen/MIGRAINE
 - https://github.com/mk36fyvy/multivitamin


The tools provides some preprocessing steps that may be used to reduce data size. All features are to
be considered experimental.
